# Boot.dev Backend Curriculum Repository

Welcome to my **Boot.dev** backend development curriculum repository! This repository contains my code, notes, and project files as I progress through the [Boot.dev Backend Track](https://www.boot.dev/tracks/backend).

- My goal is to learn backend development principles thoroughly, build a strong foundation in languages like Python, C, Go, and master essential concepts like Linux, Git, Docker, CI/CD, and more.
